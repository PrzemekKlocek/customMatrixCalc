STILL IN UPGRADING/CLEANING CODE PHASE!!!

In here you can find calculator for matrices which performs simple operations as well as decomposing.

Program can perform all typical operation on matrices as addition or transposition but
is also equipped with finding invariants of square matrix or decomposing it in QR or LU sense.
It does solve eigenproblem as well.
